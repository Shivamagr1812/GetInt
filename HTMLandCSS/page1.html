    <h1>KOTARO LIVES ALONE</h1>

    <p>The eponymous 4-5 year old main protagonist who moves into a ramshackle apartment building and becomes a next-door neighbor to manga artist Shin Karino; he also enrolls himself into a local kindergarten called Shimizu Kindergarten. Having the mental capacity of a mature adult, Kotaro is very independent for his age; Kotaro often carries around a plastic toy sword that he keeps around his hip, and acts like a samurai due to the love of his favorite cartoon Tonosaman. Over the course of the series, it is implied that Kotaro was neglected by his parents to the point where Kotaro resorted to eating tissues. At some point, Kotaro's mother abandoned him and his father, and later passed away from an unknown cause; he then left his father's custody and sent himself to go live    </p>

        <h2>HELLOHELLOHELLO</h2>
        <p>No giant robots, kaiju, epic battles or spaceships here. This is an anime about a young child prodigy who manages to live on his own after his parents disappear. As the episodes pass he makes new friends, changes lives, and encourages all those who meet him.

            While the <span>main character</span> is somewhat difficult to believe (might have been easier to swallow if he was a 10 year old instead of a 4 year old), he is well-developed enough throughout the series to become endearing.
            
            A delightful and heart-warming change from over-used anime themes. In place of action-adventure this has story and character development. Each episode is its own plot,</p>
